  <h2>About me</h2><br>
  My early interest in computational biology and the interaction between electrical engineering approaches to simulated systems led me through three degrees in Engineering, each diving deeper into computational models and statistics.
  As a data scientist, I am passionate about translating data into actionable insights.
  My academic work and work experience has focused on conducting experiments, analysing diverse datasets, and building stochastic models, inverse optimal control models, Markov models, and deep learning frameworks and predictions using several different types of datasets.
  I am experienced in Python, SQL, Matlab, and have familiarity and am eager to keep learning other languages as well. All of my experience was build on a solid understanding of statistics, probability, mathematics, and machine learning.
